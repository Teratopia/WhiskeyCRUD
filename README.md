# WhiskeyCRUD

WhiskeyCRUD is Kyle Ennis' first individual attempt at building a web application. The purpose of the app is to create, read, update, destroy, and sort different whiskeys according to taste and location. The technologies used include Java, Spring, GoogleMaps API, html, and CSS. In the future I hope to clean up the controller with better encapsulation, add Spring validation, and alter the update feature so that instead of replacing a whiskey bean's fields it calculates an average of all updates for that whiskey. Most stumbling points came from relying on java rather than using more applicable Spring practices, like recalling the DAO's get methods instead of using an @SessionAttributes tag.
